POC work for Gamified tour backend.
Proposed backend desgin: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ie89Xofto2xvcvgcCUJS6sDcfrz0DWDHMxeDNitkd68/edit

Major Endpoints:
POST `hack/user/locations/reach/`
POST `hack/user/actions/text/`

TODOs:
1. Check out Estimote Cloud, see what we can configure there.
2. adjust the location endpoint to map what Estimote provides.
3. continue train API.AI
4. make sure the context is being maintained in a conversation.
5. tune up endpoints
