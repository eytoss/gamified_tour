POC work for Gamified tour backend.

Proposed backend desgin: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ie89Xofto2xvcvgcCUJS6sDcfrz0DWDHMxeDNitkd68/edit

Endpoints temporary updated:
from `hack/user/locations/reach/` to `/location/reach/`
from `hack/user/actions/text/` to `/action/text/`

Major TODOs:

1. use models instead of hard code things.
2. integrate with iOS app.
